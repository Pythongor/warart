    text: `THE TIME WHEN IT BEGAN
Twilight. Twilight was my favorite time ever in an emerald forest, where every tree
was leaning downhills as if the strongest wind made them fall straight to the ground. I
was leaning too. So weak and tired, I followed blind the hills on the horizon
enchanted by a rosy halo of the sky.
The time when it ends. The time when it begins.
Walking every evening to find a trace of something forgotten, it’s always exciting.
Did I remember what I was searching for? Yes, I did. And the game I played was so
captivating.
Since almost four months, a young woman, full of dreams never to be fulfilled, every
night told her little baby the same story, over and over again: it was a story about a
big city abandoned by its citizens because of a cruel war led by ugly hostile
neighbors. The paths to the city were to be forgotten and never remembered. This city
was ruined and poisoned, so nobody was sure if it will be possible to live there ever
again. I remember how many times I tried to find a way to that city in a thick forest,
wandering and roaming back and forth, but I never found. It was thoroughly hidden
and buried with all that pain we experienced not so long ago.
Today I wasn’t just taking a walk. I left our settlement to find the lost city and to
finally walk along these abandoned streets covered with fragments of my memories. I
wanted to feel the dreams of those people who ran away in a hurry, who took only
those little bags to carry their belongings and ran away, so far, sadly and irrevocably.
While I was sneaking into a thicket, the darkness covered up all of the thin branches,
and my thoughts were wandering back and forth through my neural pathways. The
thoughts about war and peace, happiness and misfortune, love and hate. The thoughts
about people and how they live and die.
What is war? No fear, no pain, no tear, no regret and no warship. That’s what is the
real war. It may hurt and disrupt in the beginning, but at the end of the things it’s
nothing but strength.
The same with love. The more you endure, the more you experience, the stronger you
may become.
After this war has started I re-thought the sense of the words. I’ve become amnesiac
about my peaceful memories, they were lost in a long time flow and drown in the
deepest ocean of sorrow and pain.
Walking through the forest the main target was the “Z” sign on the trees left by the
enemy as a marker of road to the city. This road was the shortest, but a dangerous
one. Here and there the mines were hidden. But in our settlement there was a wise
man who fought himself Z-army and knew the way they marked the territory. He
taught me thoroughly so I was fully prepared. My way wasn’t easy, but since I found
the first marked tree I approached little by little my city. In some long hours, I saw
the silhouette of the burnt down high-rise blocks and my heart started beating faster.
The city where I grew, I remember seeing it for the last time. Dressed up in a
shimmering bridal gown of street lights, it was fleshing and glowing. My dear city,
you are a single mother of everything that is still breathing in here and of everything
that is already dead. You are the only one to love these streets and houses, even
ruined and destroyed. How can you be so kind to us, people inhabiting you? And how
could it be that they destroyed you so violently? How could they rape you with their
bombs? How dare they? My life here was so bright and innocent as a morning sun,
my life now is so tough and alien.
Today something pushed me to come back here. I did it as usually because of a
certain hunch. I always possess some knowledge and premonition about what is
going to happen. Last days before the war I was feeling that our habitual life is
coming to its end. Every evening seemed to be the last, every walk and every breath
of that air I took was the last, and I knew it for sure. Now I’m coming back to meet
something new, to see it with my own eyes. To experience it.
I followed the path to the park, where the perfect river view took my breath away. I
stood still and excited by the beauty of this abandoned land for some moment.
Bridges stringed across the river letting the wind to play some silent music of dead
city. I was standing and listening to it, not with my ears, but with my broken heart. I
remember them, as an old mosaic the fragments of which were lost over the years. I
remember me sitting in a taxi, late night, heading somewhere with my heart racing…
There are so many moments hard to relive, hard to recall. They are already from
another life.
After staying up all night and walking the whole morning I felt very tired. Being
already in the city center was such a bliss, because here I knew every corner. Among
grey and brown ruins covered with mud and dust I found a bright spot of neon light.
It was a great surprise to see illumination in a dead city, but I knew that as not so
much time passed after a big explosion on a factory, not all the systems are still
broken down. I approached this building. It was a betting shop all messed up with
chillers with water and beer. What a surprise! I thirstily ran to take some water and
put it in my backpack. The floor was littered by broken glass, so I produced a terrible
noise stepping on it. Once I took some water, I decided to look back to explore. It was
a frightening picture, but I was still calm. Looking in the mirror I suddenly spotted a
dark silhouette in the back of the shop. It was as if I was stabbed in the heart. My legs
where crumped up, I couldn’t move. I knew there couldn’t be anyone in this city, but
I still saw him hiding and watching me. It was a young man.
That was the moment when he noticed me. For a moment we stood still like those
wild animals who are searching for their prey in a forest, so savage. After that, our
sights met and I understood: it’s time to run.
I was accelerating as he was following me between the destroyed buildings, along the
abandoned streets and across the tiny lanes. He was too fast, I started loosing my
breath and finally understood that I can’t no longer run. He caught my wrests and
pushed me against the wall. He was so thin and tall as a tree, crowned by the
thickness of hyacinth wavy hair. So beautifully tired and neglected in this ghost city.
His face was wild. For the moment I thought so, but then our sights met once again.
His eyes were just like nuts, so brown. There was no room for wildness, no
severance, only a bit of fear. He looked straight at me and I was afraid to move, I only
looked him in the eyes.
“Who are you?” - he asked me suspiciously, almost whispering.
His voice impressed me. It was so velvet and deep. Coming from nowhere and fading
into the air, tingling the earshot.
“Nobody” - I answered.
“Me neither” - he added.
With his pretty kitten smile he still looked a bit wild, but I trusted him even though he
was just a stranger, alone in this abandoned city.
We smiled. And he finally unclenched my wrist.
“I’m sorry for this. It’s not about violence but about self defense, you know. Living
here is not safe. This silence can frighten sometimes more than a sudden sound of a
fallen brick”.
He shrugged his shoulders and at once I saw how his face has changed. It was no
longer savage. A light serenity filled him from inside as far as our sights met, and he
asked me once again, but now slightly and calmly:
“Who are you?”
“My name is Vara, I lived here when the warfare broke out. I had to run, leaving
behind all my belongings, dreams and memories. We left the city with my family and
moved to a little settlement not far from here. There was everything we needed and
no one ever returned here, because most houses were ruined and… you know it better
than I do. You live here, don’t you?”
He nodded. And I continued:
“Humans are always ready to adapt. They bear the culture inside their heads, they
transmit it over their bodies, and no matter where they go, there is always tradition,
there is life. Humans bring life to anywhere. That’s why the place we have chosen
was filled with life and culture; there appeared a tradition”.
“Wasn’t this artificially cold and even alien?” - he suddenly interrupted me.
“For sure. But then it passed. We got used to our new habits. And we even seemed to
forget the pain that war brought. But it’s just like the wound that cicatrizes, it can be
carelessly cut again and again”.
A strange thing was that we started talking as if we knew each other for a long time.
After a little pause he asked me:
“Would you mind if we have a little excursion to my place?”
I smiled. And we walked slowly next to each other, talking, smiling and laughing. It
was so astonishingly easy and calm, that I felt as if I was sleeping and he was just a
part of my crazy dream. We neared the house and went slowly upstairs. He was
looking back at me, gazing me and smiling in a strange, but surprisingly tender way.
He opened the door and we entered.
“Welcome. Feel yourself at home” - he said and smiled peacefully.
Ignoring the fact that I was alone in a ghost city, far from my family, in a totally
inanimate place with a stranger who was following me to finally bring me to his
house, I was pretty tranquil inside and even amazingly delighted with everything that
was happening. He took my backpack with water and coat and invited me to his
kitchen.
“Would you mind if I smoke?” - he asked me gently and looked me in the eyes again,
so deeply. I finally realized why his sight seemed so peculiar. It was full of politeness
and gentleness that I’ve never seen before. What a surprise to see such a gentleman in
a concrete jungle abandoned by all the living creatures. He was literally the only real
man in that area. It’s funny, but it’s true.
He lit up a cigarette and a heavy smoke filled up the kitchen.
“So why are you here?” - he asked me calmly.
“For almost four months I’ve been trying to find way back to the city where I spent
my youth, where I was born. It is so painful to understand that it will never be
returned: our homes, the streets, the trees, those smiling or unhappy faces. When you
see it every day, there’s nothing unique about it. It’s just a kind of environment. One
of the many. But when it’s gone… It hurts. Why haven’t you left?”
“People who left their homes do not belong anywhere. They are some kind of lost
souls who went neither to paradise nor to hell. They stayed somewhere in between
this two worlds: the world of dead and the world of living. I have decided to stay
because I want to belong somewhere. And here is my home, where else should I be?”
“You’re right. I’ve lost my home and even in my settlement I’m like a stranger,
though I have family and my baby constantly makes me smile.”
“You have a baby?” - he suddenly interrupted me
“Yes, I do. A little boy. Why?”
“Nothing. Just asking.”
“So you stayed here because you belong here, right? That’s a very courageous
decision. But what will you do when you run out of food?”
“When I do, I will think about it. The city will come alive. You have already returned
and so will other people do. I’m not afraid of waiting. I’m afraid of losing.”
“Sorry, I need to have some sleep. Let’s talk a bit later. I’ve been up for 22 hours!”
The walls in the kitchen and corridor were bluish or even cyan grey, such an
uncommon color. The view from the window was terrifying: a row of ruined garages
and a bunch of broken trees.
It was getting darker, the heavy clouds shackled the sky in their fluffy handcuffs. I
was too tired to continue our conversation. My new friend accompanied me to a light
bedroom of his. Seemed like I was somnambulant, not properly perceiving the
surrounding space. The geometric forms painted on his wall danced before my eyes
and I just lay down and immediately fell asleep.
Darkness. Only some flashes emerge from time to time from this almighty darkness.
No sounds, no worries. I am just an astronaut floating in space. I see stars twinkling,
flickering, and some faces, it seems to me that people are dancing. I hear a voice. So
familiar, as if it’s my own, as if I hear myself on an old recording, so weird and even
alien. Do I know this voice? Yes, I do. It’s male, it sings. His song is perfect. It is
impossible to distinguish the words but I hear the whole sound and it makes me
wanna cry.
Sometimes I can master my dreams and even control the situation there.
Now all I wanted was to see his face. Who was he? My old love, forgotten and
neglected, or my childhood friend? And why this darkness seemed so familiar to me?
I tried to focus on the voice. It was coming from everywhere, covering me with the
heaven embroidered cloths, velvet mantle with fulgent stars and the Moon dancing
gently with the Venus. The Saturn kissing silkily the Aurora. His voice was a pure
magic. His intonations enchanted me and I was literally obsessed. Oh my goodness, I
really felt a vertigo, I was falling somewhere when at once I pulled myself together
and raised my head. What was he like? I couldn’t figure it out. Maybe he was
faceless? Just an image in my head, non-existent and created by my sick fantasy.
Everything was still dark, but yet my blurry eyes made out a bright spot. I was
moving forward to look closely. I saw a perfect side-face: his feathery eyelashes and
a flawless hillside of his nose… His face was lighted by red, yellow, green, blue and
magenta constantly shifting flashing lights. He seemed unreal. Unrealistically
handsome. His eyes were closed as he was singing, holding a microphone and
moving slowly. Suddenly, I felt a cold shiver, gazing at his sculpted hands that were
holding a mic, I experienced him touching my skin, and I got chills. He kept singing.
Not looking at me at all. I was lost, though I knew it was just a dream. Should I ever
wake up? All of a sudden he looked up and stared at me fixedly. His eyes were just
like nuts, so brown…
I woke up because I felt a delicate touch of a velvet coverlet. It was cold, but
somebody carefully covered me and quietly left. I was all alone. This abandoned city,
tenebrous as the night, shadowy as this room, and the only spot of bright light has
been left in my dream. In my dream about a perfect voice singing an incantatory
chant. He purely bewitched me. But what was he like? As it often happens after
awakening, I couldn’t remember neither his face, nor his voice.
“Hey” - my new friend entered the room and sat down on the edge of the bed, - “Did
you sleep well?” - he asked me smiling.
I couldn’t answer, as I was still trying to remember the face of that person from my
dream. So he continued:
“Do you mind me singing?”
This words totally stroke me down. I slowly nodded.
He came back, settled down and started producing sounds by his sculpted fingers, the
sounds that brought me back to my dream. Was it for real? Was he real? Sitting in
front of me, waving wreaths of the sounds. He opened his mouth and started singing.
It was a sad song, full of secret senses. My heart was pounding in my chest. I’ve
never felt that happy before because his voice was perfect, as well as the music he
performed. He finished and asked me:
“Do you remember how we met? It was dark, but you were so flashy in the middle of
the dancing crowd. I have immediately spotted you, Vara. You seemed to be lost, but
you were still so beautiful in your blue cape with the wide neckline, which
neighbored your body just like the sea that caresses a shore. I was singing. For no
one, but for you, though I understand it only now. 7 years have passed after that night
which has totally messed up my life, so uneventful and full of confidence at a time. I
wanted to meet you over and over again, but I was afraid. Afraid of myself. Afraid of
seeing you. But don’t you remember those moments when a shy stranger followed
you in a tenebrous yard, we were smoking and smiling to each other, have you
forgotten? Or haven’t you? The years have passed and the only thing I’m feeling pity
about is that I was afraid.
I thought I’ll never see you again. I thought I’ll never tell you these words, but I can’t
help telling.”
He looked at me. I was numb for some time. Chained to the bed by his softly spoken
words, I finally remembered the dream I had in this very same room only half an hour
ago. I also remembered seeing his mysterious silhouette during my lonesome night
promenades and those hours spent in the dark yards, when I was contemplating the
enigmatic dances of curvy branches. He was that stranger who once in a blue moon
talked to me about the scratchy soundscapes of those yards, about magic of the
shadowy walls and about the omnipresence of the sounds. The Musician, that’s how I
called him in my most secret dreams. I remembered listening to his songs, there, in
my peaceful life. I started hearing his voice, who kept singing Too late, it’s all gone…
but it wasn’t gone. No. It was living in me, and every time I heard him it was
bringing me from my routine to the stars. He was that ghost waiting for me, he was
that faceless man, whose face I was so afraid to finally see in my dream, because I
knew that loved him. I always knew that. Was I afraid? Yes, I was. But he ran from
our future to past, and from our past to future to let us meet again. We met. We met
again as a fresh start or the last chance given to both of us not to be afraid anymore.
Even now I hear his Voyager, it’s always in my head, every sound he intertwined
with, was the quintessence of his, he was the god that towered above all the sounds
that existed in the world. I was into every noise he introduced in his music, I was into
every fracture of his ideally polished voice.
The war has cleared out my memory about a peaceful life. Sometimes I even think
I’ve become amnesiac somehow. But no amnesiac is aware of being amnesiac, right?
“Do you remember?” - he asked once again beseechingly.
“Yes, I do.”
I started crying and my heart was bitting so loudly that I could hear it in my ears. He
was looking at me so deeply, he dived in my blue eyes and I could feel it right inside
my chest, it was burning and I was loosing my breath. His eyes were just like nuts,
so…
He kissed me. His warm and silky lips enveloped mine by his breath, so smooth as
the morning sun that is caressing a thin air through a thick mist. These sunbeams
came straight through my skin. He touched my shoulders, took me gently and kept
kissing me harder. He was holding me with his sculpted hands in such a way as he
held a mic in my dream. I bet it was cinematographically beautiful. We sat on the bed,
next to his guitar, and ramous shadows on the wall tucked us with tenderness.
He was holding me closer and closer. No kiss in my life wasn’t that passionate and
sincere, no touch wasn’t that soulful. I felt his chest shuddering and every rib was
shaking as he was moving slowly and harboring me with his body. I’ve been
dreaming of him so much time, but I didn’t realize it, I was deaf and blind. I was
amnesiac. I was lost, but now I found myself at last. Being here, next to him, being
kissed and touched by him, being caressed, was all about real me. He didn’t charm
me, no. I was just meant to be charmed, I was programmed ever since I was born, to
see him one day, to hear his voice and experience his tender touches, never-to-be-
repeated by anyone on earth. His kisses were so diligent, so thirsty, and mine were
the same. My legs were cramping and my chest was burning, nothing in me was
secret anymore: everything he revealed will stay with him forever. He will sing it by
his voice, he will play it by his hands, he will exhale it by his mouth. Every part of
me he liberated was his. I wasn’t anymore myself. He was holding me even closer,
and his bones where bumping into my skin, so gently, as if we were becoming one. I
got lost in this bed, and in this room where time stood still or moved at his will. It
was a never-seen distortion of time-space where only our two bodies and minds
existed together, united and fused. Nothing mattered and nothing will matter
anymore. I feel it now much better than I felt 7 years ago. Though, I always knew it,
even at a time.
“Will we ever stop it?” - I asked him faintly.
He was lying next to me with his head on my chest, with his arms on my hips. He
was breathing quietly and with his eyes closed he was similar to a perfect painting of
Dutch masters. These glide lines, smoothly drawn and created by someone from the
outer space, I was desiring him relentlessly and even ashamed of this irresistible
feeling. He whispered:
“Let me ask you differently: should we ever stop it?”
“It’s not that easy.”
“What’s wrong?” - he asked me worryingly.
“I have family there in a settlement. I left them no letter and they are surely searching
for me now. I’m feeling ashamed. What should I do with myself? How should I stop
it if I cannot. I was led here by some unknown power. I was searching for you, not
even comprehending it. I found you. And now I don’t want to leave you ever again”. -
I was crying so helplessly. My head was tearing apart as well as my heart.
“You should decide: to stay or to leave. I’ll understand you whatever you choose.”
“Don’t ask me to do that, you know that I want to hear something different.”
“What exactly?”
“I want to hear you can’t do without me. I want you to hold me close, not to let me
ago ever again. Not to lose me because of your fear. Why should I explain that?”
He was silent again. Then he looked at me and held me tight and said:
“I cannot make you stay, but I want you not to leave. You know that better than the
words can say.”
Yes, I knew that better than the words could say. As well as I knew that I would never
get him out of my mind.
“Yes… I will never get you out of my mind. I’ve been asking myself so many times
what is so special about you that makes me suffer when I imagine us not being
together now, but I cannot understand it no matter how hard I try. Is there something
in your face or in your voice? Yes, surely. But it’s also in everything you create.
When I saw your drawings, I’ve felt it in them. When I’ve heard your music, I’ve
also felt it. The art of any other person on earth has never immersed me in such a
state of mind, that I have experienced with you. In your music there is something
about a special intonation or rhythm, that cannot be found anywhere else. Your
uniqueness is you yourself, no matter what you do, what you say or what you create,
it is soaked with your spirit, your soul and it seems to me that I feel it more than any
tangible item in the whole world, as if I felt you whole just listening to your music or
contemplating your drawings. See? I am crazy. I am mad about you, and it has been
happening for a long while, I just have forgotten it”.
***
Time was passing slowly… Day and night, we were talking to each other, caressing
each other and kissing. The world around us ceased to exist for a while and even the
houses seemed to be restored and rebuilt by themselves, without outside interference.
Everything was beautifully silent and only we were heard singing in this lost
paradise. We were singing our favorite songs lying on the bed, sitting on the floor,
standing in the corridor. We were singing to each other, looking into each other’s
eyes, touching each other and smiling. Maybe there was no other better moment in
my life, but was it all for real?
It was some kind of fairytale where only two heroes existed. It was planned as a
perfect scenario, everything: how we met, how I remembered him, how he confessed
to me. It seemed to be totally unreal, but yet not wrong at all. When he was looking at
me he was smiling and slightly shaking his head as if he couldn’t believe it was
happening to us. Maybe he was constantly asking himself if I was real.
Generally, I was the happiest person in the world, but thinking in particular I knew
that this city would slowly kill us, but I could not say it out loud. I was simply afraid
of losing him. Should I start this conversation, he would get angry at me, I knew that.
So I became amorphous for some time: two months passed by as one day, in his arms,
my head on his chest, my hands in his hands, my lips next to his. I was dreaming of
him, when I was next to him, with my eyes open and shut I saw nothing but his face.
He was everything, everyone and everywhere. He was all. That’s when I started
worrying. Wasn’t that some kind of dependence? Illness? Day by day it was
regressing: his sight was becoming less tender, his touches were less caressing, our
talks less soulful, kisses less silky. He was hiding in his room, sometimes even for
hours, sleeping and playing music without me. I started feeling as if I had nothing to
do with this place. Though he embraced me time after time. Maybe he was just
apologizing without words.
Once we were sneaking into the city center to find some food. The trams were upside
down. The silence was overwhelming. It was on a day when it began. This hard and
filthy air was strangling me. I suddenly stopped and started choking. He got scared
and asked me something in panic. I couldn’t even hear a word, my ears were all
stuffed up. He gave me water from his backpack and I drank long and deep. We
returned home without food, and even without water. He was so angry at me. He
threw his backpack and went to the kitchen. I still felt bad, that was obviously
because of those chemical spills after the explosion on a big factory not far from here.
I followed him and asked him quietly:
“You think it’s because of explosion?”
“Why asking if you know the answer?”
He was so burdensome. I’ve never seen him so bellicose before. He continued.
“By the way, I’m running out of cigarets. And we went to buy them this morning.”
“And I felt bad, so we returned… That’s the reason of your anger?”
“No way. Just telling.”
We were silent for some time. Than he asked me:
“Are you disappointed?”
“Why asking if you know the answer?”
He started laughing. I felt burning in my chest. After all that tenderness he gave me,
why being so cruel, why so ruthless? He knew that I loved him. Why being so angry,
why choosing his comfort not me? I didn’t belong there, it was surely true. It was
painful, but it was the only truth. He was used to live alone. He was used to being
himself as well as any of us. Me too, I was myself. But I felt that he changed me. He
made me more decisive. He made me beautiful. For the first time in my life I felt
myself totally beautiful, I have never thought I could be that beautiful. I adored my
hair. My body. I felt that I am loved, no one ever gave me that feeling. Not being
loved physically. I am being entirely loved. That’s a magnificent feeling… Nothing
could compare to it. It’s like being blessed, being elated. He made me an Angel, made
me a Rose. I was burning in red fire and diving in blue waters, he made me a Flame.
After all that, how can I ever leave him? But, regardless, how can I live here to die? I
whispered to his ear crying my eyes out:
“You know what hurts me the most? Not these ruins, not your life in this gloomy and
cold trinket shack, not the possibility to starve to death in this godforsaken city or to
be choked by the poison dust. What hurts me most it’s nothing but you yourself
having no dreams. It hurts me so much that I can’t breathe, it burns my chest and
somewhere inside it’s aching. I saw your fervent eyes when you were singing. I
thought that was your dream, music. But now I see that you have it enough. You need
no more. And you don’t need me neither. Maybe I was your only dream left and I
came true. But for the sake of love tell me why can’t you think of my comfort, my
safety, why do you force me to stay here if that’s our sentence? If you have loved me,
you would have taken your backpack and left this dead city not to become a
biomaterial.
To dream you have to have dreams. But it seems to me that you don’t.”
“You want to leave? Then leave. I won’t ever regret it.”
His face was so wild. His eyes were so black, just like holes. He wasn’t looking at
me. He averted his eyes and this emptiness filled up a silent room. I wanted to say
You liar, but I managed to contain myself.
“You leave? Or you stay?” - he finally asked me neglectfully after a long pause.
“Why are you so severe, when it doesn’t go your way?” - I asked him strictly, - “It’s
the easiest thing to bristle at me. You do that, but you never think of the consequences
that may hurt me. And the main thing is, that it may hurt you. I don’t want to leave
you, but I know it’s the only way I could…”
“So you stay”.
“I’ve not finished yet. Listen, there’s no future left at all in this city. The streets are
empty, the houses are downfallen. It smells like death and desperation. What are you
eager to find here? There’s no hope, and even no fear. There’s nothing. Because it’s a
cursed no man’s land. Because everything is dead inside and out. Of course, I want to
stay, because I cannot give you up to the mercy of fate. But I want you to share my
daydreams, to fantasize with me. I know it’s hard for you, but if you need me, the
dreams themselves will appear before your eyes. Have you ever dreamt about me?”
“Yes, I did. Damn it, of course I did! For so many years I did, not constantly but it
came to my mind that we could have been together, and I never believed it could
happen one day, but you are here now, deciding whether to leave or to stay, and I
don’t know how I can convince you. Maybe I shouldn’t convince you at all.”
“You didn’t answer about your dreams.”
“I don’t know what to say.”
He was silent for some time, but then I saw his face changing.
“Sometimes I am daydreaming. Different images appear in my mind. It’s about love
or about music, I’m not really sure. I am too weak, if emotional, and daydreaming is
all about emotions. Sometimes it is easier to create something than to describe it
through words. They don’t come easy. So I cannot explain it.”
I started caressing his shoulder and he leaned on me gently. I was stroking his back as
he continued:
“I was so afraid of the word Love. It frightened me so much, but if Love is so warm
as it feels now, why should I be afraid then?… Not really, it’s not so easy. It is so
warm at the beginning, but when it changes, little by little, the feelings transform and
it is such a hard work to save them, to cherish one another. Will I be able to do that?
What guarantees exist to ensure that love will last, that you won’t get fed up with me?
I don’t know. Look at me, I am too boring to captivate you, I think you’re into me
only because of my music.”
“Stop it, please. It’s nonsense.”
“Then why have you fallen for me when I was singing?”
“My goodness, because your voice is heavenly! But that’s not all. I have fallen for
you also because your face is gorgeous, your melodies are radiant, your eyes are
profound, your laugh is sweet, your moves are tender, your hands are caressing, your
heart is loving and your smile is hopeful. That’s what you wanted to hear? I am in
love with you, because you are you, and I cannot find another you, except you.”
He smiled at me and kissed me tenderly. Then I continued:
“But I cannot conceal the fact that your life is hopeless, your actions are desperate
and your habits are sometimes disquieting. And I have two diametrically opposite
feelings inside me: the one is telling me that I cannot live without you and I will
never find a person like you, so close and so unique, so kind and so loving; another is
telling that I have no right to put pressure on you. That’s already not love, not the real
one, when someone is pushing another person. It seemed to me that I was ready to
leave you, but then I felt it inside my chest, this extreme warmth, this all-embracing
feeling that people call Love, you know. I think here it comes. It happens to me, I
cannot resist it, I depend on you or call it as you want.”
He held me closer. And whispered slightly to my ear:
“I love you. And you’ll stay here with me, because if we lose it once we won’t ever
go back. The paths to the city will be forgotten and you won’t ever remember us, or
will you?”
“I’m not staying if you do not change.”
“Then you don’t love me. People love each other just the way they are, they are not
supposed to change each other.”
“You’re wrong. People change each other so badly, that they turn into new ones. They
influence each other slightly, without pressure. If you love you adapt, as well as if
you leave some place into the unknown, you adapt, because you need to survive. And
now I see you in front of me, and I feel a terrible pain inside when I imagine myself
leaving you, but It’s also aching when I imagine us dying here, miserable and
wretched. What do you think of this scenario?”
“I think that you are constantly exaggerating. Just relax and stay here, it will be just
fine. I’m living here, see? And it’s all right. There are so many shops and warehouses
where people left non-perishable products and cigarets. I find them and take this
food, and I am okay with it.”
“And what's then? When it’s all over, when you run out of water? What will you do
then?”
“I’m not thinking of such distant future, I hope this city will soon come alive. It’s
been only several months since the war has ended, and I am pretty sure that people
will start to come back soon, as you did. So there’s no cause for concern. I’ll deal
with it.”
And he became cold and distant again. It was so painful to see him turning his head,
lighting up a cigaret and staring indifferently at a single point. What was he? Maybe
just the shadow of my mind, or maybe the light of my existence. I was staring at him.
He was clear and dim at the same time, and his eyes tied my hands every time I tried
to unravel them. After the war began, I have changed a lot. The war always makes us
understand the relativity of what we are used to and what we really need. It brings us
up like little babies, arrogant and noisy, and we finally become mature. And our
feelings are also tested: there is a ruined bridge between us. We can be so close, but
still so distant. Like those shiny stars that seem to be so close but we see them with
such an unreal delay. I’m afraid to lose you. Afraid to see you with such delay,
understand your feelings when they have already lost their actuality, hear your voice
when you are already silent, read your words when they already don’t matter. It’s my
biggest fear.
It’s not so easy to live. But if the living is easy what’s the purpose of your life? My
life wasn’t easy. But now I know it was. It was flourishing and its perfume was
similar to the scent of spring flowers. Now we wither. What path am I choosing? A
path to die? Or to survive and never repeat the same mistakes? They are so easy to be
repeated. Why should I forget you, can I do it now when the world around us is
almost ruined, though both of us were ruined long before. Now every choice is the
choice of a lifetime.
“I’m leaving.”
He turned back his head with his glance panicked and shocked, and for some time he
was just gazing at me. So surprised about my choice. I started slowly quitting his
kitchen, heading towards the entrance door. He grabbed me by the arm and we were
peering into each other for some infinitely long minutes. It was insupportable. I
couldn’t look him in the eyes. They were just like nuts, so brown. I’ve never felt like
this before: I wished I could die right away, become a part of him, as a dead soldier’s
body becomes a part of the soil. Yes, my thoughts were that tough. I wanted to
disappear completely not to feel this way ever again. Not to leave him and at the
same time not to stay. I wished this house could have been ruined long before we
entered it, I wished I was deaf and have never listened to his music, I wished he was
mute not to sing to me ever before, I wished we were both blind not to gaze at one
another right now. But I was still alive and my decision was made. I told him:
“If you’re cold, I’m hot. If I’m cold, you’re hot. Why can’t it be like at the beginning
when both of us were warm and tender? Is it the illness of every couple, of any
human relationships, isn’t it? There’s no balance and no reciprocation, ever. I knew
that, but I truly believed that once I’ll meet a man with whom it will be sincerely
appreciated: everything I do, everything I give away without asking something in
return. When I remembered my old feelings it was so close to that dream, the dream I
cherished for so many years in my heart, that I even believed in miracles. But now I
got hurt once again, because every time I start to believe in something, it disappears,
it fades away as little pebbles when the ebb is flowing seaward to wash them away.
Everything that’s left is my love to you, I will hide it inside, so deeply that I can
barely remember what it was, but it will never disappear completely, only when I do.”
After these words were said, I ran away, grabbing only my backpack and crying out
loud. I was running down the street and screaming so desperately that it seemed to
me I was turning inside out as an old cloth wishing to become new. But it couldn’t
happen, I was already soaked in his love that I won’t ever forget. So I started
screaming to myself:
“Whatever happens, I promise me not to forget not to neglect this feeling. It is
unique, and no feeling on earth won’t ever be the same. No matter how hard it will
be, no matter how long it will take, I want to remember this feeling and caress it till
the very end of my days. Is this possible?!
I thought I knew what was love, but I was wrong. Because love is not only the way
you look at somebody, it’s truly the way somebody looks at you, and only then about
how you look back. It’s your secret inside, that you keep and it’s the smile you get
from somebody to smile back. It’s about embrace it’s about a kiss.
It’s about what I feel when he caresses my skin. It’s that I’m losing consciousness,
when he just seats in front of me, just looks at me the way he always does. Happily, I
finally feel it. I have been thinking that love is when I give away. But no, it’s not. It’s
when he just touches my skin and I feel it as if my skin hurts, or something like that,
as if there is electrics in his fingers, but it’s not a pain, it’s a desire to get closer, to
touch him more. To merge into him, to feel him near, aside, beside, inside. It’s about
every second spent with him, about the process. It’s about each centimeter of his
flesh, it’s about his body. I love him so much, that I lose my mind, I smell his body,
his hair, I touch him, I hug him. I enjoy laying down near him. Every day with him is
a bliss, there’s nothing I will be afraid of, not anymore.
Whatever happens, I promise myself not to forget these days”.
I fell. For a moment I was lying on the cold ground and trying to understand if it was
the wrong or the right way round. Then suddenly I realized that I was all alone
somewhere in suburbs. The «Z» signs were everywhere. Every house and every tree
was marked. It felt like death, it felt like…Twilight. It felt like twilight. Deep and
somber. Don’t you remember? Twilight was my favorite moment ever in an emerald
forest, but not this time. It wasn’t the time when it began, it was the time when it
ended. The way back was so clear, I was already in the forest, out of danger, but still
exhausted. My knees were wiggling, but I felt I need to stand up and go ahead.
All of a sudden some aircrafts flew over my head. That was such a familiar sound, the
sound of the war. I was frightened and I ran towards the brushwood. A never-ending
procession of aircrafts flew northwards, straight into the city. In some seconds I’ve
heard the first explosion. It was so massive and powerful that my ears were plugged
up. After that the chain of explosions started and the flaming silhouette of the ghost-
city was blazing before my eyes. I was trembling. That was the end of my hometown,
the end of everything I had. But that wasn’t the thing. He left there. Alone. And now
he was dead.
“He’s gone... He’s gone!” - I fell powerlessly on the ground, screaming it through
tears and wishing I could have stayed for one more day to share it with him, this
moment of death. My heart was ripped into pieces, when suddenly I’ve heard a voice
over the raging buzz of the missile strikes.
“Vara, wait!”
He was chasing me all the time, ever since I slammed his door and started running
away. He ran up to me and started suffocating:
“I… I… I didn’t want you to leave, you know that, right? I…”
I kissed him.
And maybe it was the time when it began.
